# Detecting-Meaning-Shift-in-Social-Media
As language develops over time, so do words' meanings. This is particularly true in social media, where the dynamic nature causes semantic shifts to happen more quickly and make it difficult for NLP models to handle new content and trends.  
The aim is to determine whether or not the target word's meaning is the same when given a pair of phrases (or, in this example, tweets) and the word in question, such as delta. 
The framing basically consists of the same binary classification as the original WiC (Word-in-Context) job modified to take into account temporal considerations (tweets in each pair were chosen from distinct time periods).
The word "folklore," for instance, underwent a semantic change in the second case, where its definition now refers to a current music release.
(1) It is obvious that now is the ideal moment to view videos about folklore monsters because there is a rainstorm outside. September 2019
(2) My favorite song is Cardigan from Folklore. (August 2020) I wish @taylorswift13 would adore me.
